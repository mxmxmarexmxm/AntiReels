# AntiReels

## Description
AntiReels is a simple extension for Firefox that helps you stay focused and productive by blocking short content from Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. It is designed for users who find themselves easily distracted by endless scrolling through short content on these social media platforms during work hours.

## Features:
- The extension hides short/reels icons in the sidebar menu on Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, allowing you to avoid temptation and stay focused on your tasks
- Instagram:
- Hide reels from chat: With this new functionality, the extension allows you to hide reels from chat. 
- Hide reels when accessing through direct link: Now, when you access reels directly, the extension will automatically hide them from your view. 
- It does not collect any personal data, ensuring your privacy and security while using the extension.
- Future Plans:
  - Selective blocking: Customize which social media platforms to block shorts from, giving you more control over your browsing experience.
  - Direct link popups: When accessing short content through direct links on Facebook and YouTube, the extension will display a popup that blocks the content. Instagram already has this feature.
  - Timer functionality: Set a timer for watching shorts, and when the time is up, receive a popup notification and automatically stop playing the content.
  - Cross-browser compatibility: Plan to expand the extension's compatibility to other popular web browsers, providing a wider range of users with the benefits of AntiReels.

By using AntiReels, you can maintain better focus, increase productivity, and regain control over your browsing habits.
